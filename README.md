# Document RAG Tool
A full-stack Document-based Question Answering (RAG) tool that allows users to upload documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, JPG) and ask questions about them. The system extracts text (OCR + parsing), chunks it, performs semantic search using FAISS, and uses a conversational LLM (e.g., DeepSeek, Google GenAI) to answer with source citations.
